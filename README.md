# Finance-Signal-Generator
## Problem Statement

Analyzing financial data and extracting actionable insights is a complex and time-consuming process, especially for investors and analysts dealing with large datasets from multiple sources. Traditional methods often lack automation, real-time updates, or predictive capabilities, making it challenging to quickly identify trends and generate actionable signals for decision-making.

This project addresses the need for:

1. **Automated Financial Data Processing**: Efficiently fetching and processing financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow) from public APIs.
2. **Signal Generation**: Providing clear and concise buy/sell signals based on financial metric trends.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Leveraging machine learning models to forecast future trends based on historical data.
4. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Including real-time market data to enhance decision-making.
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing earnings call transcripts for deeper insights into the sentiment behind financial performance.

## Solution

This Python application fetches financial data from the [Financial Modeling Prep API](https://financialmodelingprep.com), processes it to identify trends, and generates actionable signals. Key features include:

- **Automated Financial Data Retrieval**: Retrieve income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow data for a given stock symbol.
- **Trend Analysis and Signal Generation**: Analyze quarter-over-quarter trends in key metrics and provide buy/sell recommendations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilize a linear regression model to forecast future trends.
- **Real-Time Market Data**: Integrate stock price information to complement generated signals.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate earnings call transcripts for sentiment insights.
